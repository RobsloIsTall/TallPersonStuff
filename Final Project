# How to Choose Storage for a Computer

 Written by: Robby Lothian

## Who is this for and what's in it?
For anyone looking to buy a computer but doesn't know what size or type of storage to get to fit their needs without costing them time or money, this guide is for you. In it you will learn about the different types of storage and how much storage you really need. 

# The Types of Storage
There are two main storage types when it comes to computers.
1. Hard Drives

Hard drives use spinning platters and and needle head to store files, it's like an ultra fast and dense record or CD. They come in two main form factors; 2.5" drives, and 3.5" drives. 2.5" drives are almost exclusively used for laptops. They both use SATA for power and data. Hard drives can also come in different speeds, with the most popular being 7200 rpm followed by 5400 rpm, which is slightly slower due to its slower rpm. A typical 7200 rpm hard drive will get read/write performance of about 150 MB/s.

2. SSDs

SSDs use NAND flash, similar to flash drives and to the storage found inside your phone. SSDs also come in two main form factors; 2.5" drives, and M.2 drives. 2.5" drives use SATA for power and data while M.2 drives are usually 80 mm long sticks, about the same size as a stick of gum, that use the M.2 connector found on your motherboard. M.2 drives can also use two different protocols, the slower SATA, or the much faster NVMe. SATA SSDs max out at about 600 MB/s read /write, while new PCI-E 4.0 M.2 SSDs are capable of 5,000 MB/s read/write, and are getting better everyday.

# How Much Storage?
With how much work people do online and in the cloud, people need local storage _less_ and _less_. Depending on what you what to keep on your computer will help determine how much storage you actually need. Do you plan on mostly using Google Docs and are all your photos in the cloud? You can probably get away with 250 GB. Do you download documents or otherwise work with small files? 500 GB is likely enough. One Terabyte (TB) is the most some could need in most cases, beyond that you will likely know if you need more. You can also check programs you regularly use to see how much storage they require.

# What Should You Buy?
For most people a 500 GB SATA SSD is all you need. At this point most people aren't storing files locally, and SATA SSDs provide the value and real world speed compared to hard drives and NVMe SSDs. While hard drives offer double the storage at about the same price (~$45), the speed of an SSD will offer a big enough quality of life improvement to justify it. If you need a Terabyte it's only about $30 more compared to a 500 GB SATA SSD. But if you need lots of storage, and it doesn't matter how fast it is, hard drives offer the best price to capacity ratio.
